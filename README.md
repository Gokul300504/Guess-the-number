# Guess-the-number:
We are creating a python based game project using while loop
and if statement with which we will be entering the range of
values in which we will be guessing a number.The process will
be mainly based on decision making which is very similar to
one of the selecting technique off machine learning

THE ALGORITHM THAT WE ARE USING HERE IS :
• User inputs the lower bound and upper bound of the
range.
• The compiler generates a random integer between the
range and store it in a variable for future references.
• For repetitive guessing, a while loop will be initialized.
• If the user guessed a number which is greater than a
randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try
Again! You guessed too high“ .
• Else If the user guessed a number which is smaller than a
randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try
Again! You guessed too small”.
• And if the user guessed in a minimum number of
guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations! ” Output.
• Else if the user didn’t guess the integer in the minimum
number of guesses, he/she will get “Better Luck Next
Time!” output.

OUTPUT WILL LOOK LIKE:

Enter Lower bound:-10
Enter Upper bound:-20

        You've only  3 chances to guess the integer!

Guess a number :-25
You guessed too high!
Guess a number :-22
You guessed too high!
Guess a number :-15
You guessed too high!
Guess a number :-14
Congratulations you did it in  4 try
